  <h1>Project Application</h1>

  <p>We're excited that you want to support Philly Bike Action by leading a new project!

  <p><b>Philly Bike Action is happy to support and facilitate projects that align with our mission!</b> Past projects include: initiatives for new/improved bike lanes, engagements with City Council, bike lane cleanups, direct action demonstrations for safe streets, and more.</p>

  <p>Please use this form to submit an application to the Board of Directors for a new project. We will review it and get back to you as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>If your project is accepted, we will share helpful how-to documents to get you started. However, <b>you</b> will be responsible for organizing the project until its completion. We encourage you to proactively ask for help and guidance from experienced PBA organizers to ensure the project follows PBA processes and quality standards.</p>

  <p>Have questions? Please reach out to <a href="mailto:info@bikeaction.org">info@bikeaction.org</a>.</p>
