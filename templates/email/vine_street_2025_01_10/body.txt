Provide feedback on [PennDOT’s Concept Plan for Vine Street](https://www.pa.gov/agencies/penndot/projects-near-you/district-6-projects/vine-st-corridor-safety-improvements.html) by January 31\!

PennDOT is [collecting feedback](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=iYN8F3s7qEm36MfzaGvgSWlpo6d20elGqQ2khlGtQVZUMzFZUDlTNUlLM0YzMUFKM0M4WDNOOVg5Sy4u&route=shorturl) on its plans to install safety improvements on Vine St, which include eastbound and westbound bike lanes. Sadly, their revised plans will make the eastbound bike lane more dangerous by placing it between a travel lane and a parking lane, which will put bicyclists in the dangerous “door zone.” 

*It is critical that those who support better bike infrastructure and safer streets provide their input on this project*.

Tell PennDOT not to backtrack on safety by using our recommended answers when submitting the [public comment form](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=iYN8F3s7qEm36MfzaGvgSWlpo6d20elGqQ2khlGtQVZUMzFZUDlTNUlLM0YzMUFKM0M4WDNOOVg5Sy4u&route=shorturl):

1. **Do you support the addition of a westbound bike lane on Vine Street from 13th Street to 9th Street?**

	Yes, but more should be done to make the bike lane safer. The updated design places the westbound bike lane between the “door zone” and fast moving vehicular traffic on Vine Street, creating a serious risk to people using the bike lane. The bike lane should be adjacent to the curb, and there is sufficient room for a curbside, parking separated bike lane. The westbound bike lane should also extend to Broad Street to prevent leaving bicyclists stranded when they reach 13th Street. I also support removing metered street parking along Vine Street westbound so that the bike lane can be adjacent to the curb.

2. **Do you support the reconfiguration of bike lanes on the 10th and 13th Street overpasses by shifting the bike lane to curbside with added lane separator curb?**

	Yes.

3. **Do you support maintaining metered street parking along Vine Street EB between 11th Street and 9th Street?**

	No. Remove the metered street parking on Vine St eastbound between 11th and 9th Street. The safety of bike lane users will be compromised by maintaining metered street parking, which places people using the bike lane in the dangerous “door zone”. PennDOT should restore the original design in Concept Plan Version 1\. 

   

4. **Do you support the installation of speed slots (speed humps) with signing and advanced pavement markings along Vine Street WB between 10th Street and 8th Street?**

	Yes. Please also install speed slots in the school zone between 13th Street and Broad	Street. 

5. **Do you support the installation of School Zone Pavement Markings along Vine Street WB?**

	  
	Yes.

6. **Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback on the revised concept. Please use the space below to provide any additional comments regarding the project.**

	Extend the westbound Vine Street road diet to Broad Street. PennDOT should  
maintain two travel lanes through 13th Street before adding a third travel lane as traffic approaches Broad Street. This would drastically improve the safety for all road users travelling along or across Vine Street, without significant impacts to level of service.

**Deadline to comment: Thursday, January 31**

Thank you for taking action to make Vine Street safer for bike users\!
