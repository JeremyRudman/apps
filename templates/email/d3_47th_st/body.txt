Subject: Support for the 47th Street Bike Lane – Please Bring It Up for a Vote This Session

Dear Council Member Gauthier,

I’m writing as a resident of West Philadelphia to urge you to bring the bills to create the 47th Street bike lane up for a vote this council session.

Your leadership on street safety has made West Philadelphia more accessible and sustainable, and I see the 47th St lane as a critical next step in the right direction. As you know, protected bike lanes reduce crashes and save lives, so it’s crucial that the plan moves forward without changes that would undermine cyclist safety or compromise the safety of all road users.

Our community is counting on you to make 47th Street safer for everyone.

Thank you for your time and your commitment to our neighborhoods.

Sincerely,  
\[Your Name\]  
\[Your Address or Neighborhood\]  
\[Your Email/Phone Number, if desired\]
