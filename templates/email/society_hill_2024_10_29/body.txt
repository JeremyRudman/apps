If you live within the boundaries of the map below, please attend and voice your support for safety upgrades during the public comment opportunity. Here are some reasons why we support the City’s proposal: 

* **Separated bike lanes** reduce conflict and stress between drivers and people on bikes.  
* Concrete protection keeps ***all users safe*** including pedestrians and drivers.  
* Separation **limits aggressive driving** and acts as a **buffer** between people on the street and speeding cars.  
* Proposed changes would **prevent drivers from swerving** around other cars, stopping drivers like the one who killed Dr. Barbara Friedes.  
* **Emergency services** review every plan to ensure response times are never impacted.   
* Safe protected bike lanes increase ridership, which **reduces car congestion.**  
* Safe and unobstructed bike lanes **reduce sidewalk riding**.  
* Unlike speed enforcement, concrete buffers offer **24/7 safety** improvements.  
* **Loading Zones** manage unloading needs without putting others at risk.  
* Everyone deserves to **get home alive**, no matter how they choose to travel.
