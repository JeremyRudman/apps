Hi {{ signature.first_name }},

Thank you for signing the petition to [extend the bike lane and pedestrian safety measures](https://apps.bikeaction.org/campaigns/support-the-22nd-street-bike-lane-in-fairmount-res) on 22nd Street from Fairmount Avenue to Brown Street. We need your help to ensure the Fairmount Civic Association (FCA) approves this project.

**Take Action** 

* **Attend the next FCA meeting** to support the 22nd Street Traffic Safety Project. FCA has specifically requested feedback from Fairmount residents to decide if they want to approve this project. (Thursday, October 24, 7:30pm @ City School, 860 N. 24th St)  
* **Send an email to Tim Butters**, President of FCA at [president@fairmountcivicassociation.org](mailto:president@fairmountcivicassociation.org) by Wednesday, October 23\.  
  * In the email, please include:  
1. Your name and home address  
2. Why extending the bike lane on 22nd Street from Fairmount Avenue to Brown Street is important to you. Personal stories and experiences are encouraged. 

Thank you for making our neighborhood safer for all neighbors, including children at Bache-Martin and the Eastern State Playpen Playground.

**Please share this email with your neighbors [in FCA](https://apps.bikeaction.org/rcos/find/) who support traffic safety\!**
