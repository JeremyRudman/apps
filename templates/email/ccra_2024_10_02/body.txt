The City of Philadelphia is presenting "the plan" for **concrete protection** of the Spruce and Pine bike lanes on **Tuesday, October 8**, 2024 to the *Center City Residents Association ([CCRA](https://www.centercityresidents.org))* at their monthly board [meeting](https://www.centercityresidents.org/event-5897215).

***This meeting is ONLY open to Members of CCRA.** Our records show you are a resident of CCRA and eligible to become a Member. Membership is $60/yr or $45/yr under 40\. [Join CCRA today](https://centercityresidents.org/Joins) to attend the Board Meeting as a member.*

**Meeting Details:** Tuesday, October 8 | 6:00PM | *BEX Meeting Space, 2005 Market St*  
*CCRA is asking that Members **register** in advance [here](https://www.centercityresidents.org/event-5897215).*

We are expecting a plan that includes a **combination of concrete pills and crash-rated planters** along with the addition of more Loading Zones. It's crucial that residents who support better bike lanes have their voice heard in this private setting.

**Should you become a member?** Participating in your neighborhood civic association is one of the most impactful things you can do as a resident to ensure that positive voices for better bike infrastructure are in the room when decisions are made.

You can still email your opinion on the design of the protection, even if you are not a Member (be sure to include your address): [centercity@centercityresidents.org](mailto:centercity@centercityresidents.org)

Well designed bike lane protection has the following features:

* **Shape:** Raised curbs, or concrete pills should be tall enough to prevent cars from driving over them. Shape should not be sloped.  
* **Placement:** Occasional gaps to allow bikes to enter or exit the bike lane. Gaps should never be wide enough to permit a vehicle to wedge in.   
* **Protect** **intersections** to prevent cars from pulling in or backing into bike lane  
* **Loading Zones** to more effectively manage temporary parking needs
