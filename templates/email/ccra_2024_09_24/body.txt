The City of Philadelphia is presenting "the plan" for **concrete protection** of the Spruce and Pine bike lanes on **Tuesday, October 8**, 2024 to the *Center City Residents Association ([CCRA](https://www.centercityresidents.org))* at their monthly board meeting. 

***This meeting is ONLY open to Members of CCRA.** Find out if you live within the boundaries of CCRA using our [easy form tool](http://apps.bikeaction.org/rcos/find). Membership is $60/yr or $45/yr under 40\. [Join CCRA today](https://centercityresidents.org/Joins) to attend the Board Meeting as a member.*

**Meeting Details:** Tuesday, October 8 | 6:00PM | *BEX Meeting Space, 2005 Market St*

We are expecting a plan that includes a **combination of concrete pills and crash-rated planters** along with the addition of more Loading Zones. It's crucial that residents who support better bike lanes have their voice heard in this private setting.

**Should you become a member?** Participating in your neighborhood civic association is one of the most impactful things you can do as a resident to ensure that positive voices for better bike infrastructure are in the room when decisions are made.

If you **live** within CCRA, you can still email your opinion on the design of the protection, even if you are not a Member (be sure to include your address): [centercity@centercityresidents.org](mailto:centercity@centercityresidents.org)

Well designed bike lane protection has the following features:

* **Shape:** Raised curbs, or concrete pills should be tall enough to prevent cars from driving over them. Shape should not be sloped.  
* **Placement:** Occasional gaps to allow bikes to enter or exit the bike lane. Gaps should never be wide enough to permit a vehicle to wedge in.   
* **Protect** **intersections** to prevent cars from pulling in or backing into bike lane  
* **Loading Zones** to more effectively manage temporary parking needs
