2 Minute Action Requested: We need YOU to [submit a comment](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=iYN8F3s7qEm36MfzaGvgSWlpo6d20elGqQ2khlGtQVZUQlJRQlo5WDlYRTRXUzFQSDJNTjBKODlFSC4u&route=shorturl) asking PennDOT to make the plan for Vine Street safer for bike users and pedestrians\!

**Don’t wait\! Comment deadline is this Thursday, October 31\. (spooky\!)**

The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (“PennDOT”) is seeking public comment on its [Vine Street Corridor Safety Improvements project](https://www.penndot.pa.gov/RegionalOffices/district-6/ConstructionsProjectsAndRoadwork/Philadelphia/Pages/Vine-St.-Corridor-Safety-Improvements.aspx). 

<span style="width: 80%; text-align: center;"><img style="width: 100%; border-radius: 5px; border: solid grey;" src="templates/email/vine_street_2024_10_30/images/proposed.png"></span>

PBA has proposed the following safety upgrades:

* Extend the westbound road diet from 11th Street to Broad Street
* Install a westbound bike lane between Broad Street and 8th Street
* Add intermediate-term protection on the eastbound bike lane (plastic flexposts are not good enough and will not stop moving vehicles from entering the bike lane)
* Reduce points of contact between bikes and cars on the 10th and 13th Street overpasses by moving the bike lane to be adjacent to the curb.
* Install bike signals on the 10th and 13th Street overpasses
* Install curb-separation on the eastbound bike lane as it enters 8th Street

**Please take a moment to [submit a comment](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=iYN8F3s7qEm36MfzaGvgSWlpo6d20elGqQ2khlGtQVZUQlJRQlo5WDlYRTRXUzFQSDJNTjBKODlFSC4u&route=shorturl) and tell PennDOT to add PBA’s proposed safety upgrades to the project plan.**	

We recommend copying and pasting the above bulleted list into Question \#1 on the comment form, and adding any additional ideas you may have to increase safety.

**Deadline to comment: tomorrow, Thursday, October 31**
