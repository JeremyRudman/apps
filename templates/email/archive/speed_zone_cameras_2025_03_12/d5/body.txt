Yesterday, **Councilmember Jeffrey Young Jr. voted [not to advance a bill](https://whyy.org/articles/school-zone-speed-cameras-bill-philadelphia/)** that would help protect school kids in neighborhoods most impacted by traffic violence by **installing speed cameras at Philly's top 7 most dangerous School Zones**. More about the bill and schools [here](https://www.phillyvoice.com/philly-schools-automated-speed-cameras-bill).

Speed cameras are proven to change driver behavior and make streets safer by [reducing crashes and their severity](https://philapark.org/wp-content/uploads/2023-Speed-Camera-Report-Final-32023.pdf). OTIS spent a year analyzing and ranking every School Zone in Philly to determine these 7 locations \- but CM Jeffery Young Jr. (D5) and CM Cindy Bass (D8) decided to hold the bill indefinitely.

According to the City, on average**, 1 child is hit by a car while walking every school day**.

It's not too late \- Call to say you **support Bill \#250148** and want it to advance at the next committee meeting. Call your district Council Member and Committee Chair, **Jefferey Young Jr.** today\!
