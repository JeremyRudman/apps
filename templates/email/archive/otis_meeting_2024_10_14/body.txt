<img src="templates/email/otis_meeting_2024_10_14/images/publicmeeting.png" style="width: 100%">

The City of Philadelphia is holding a [public open house](https://www.phila.gov/media/20241009124536/SprucePineBikeLaneUpgradeProject_MeetingFlyer_10.17.24.pdf) to gather *community input* on its plan to **protect** the Spruce and Pine bike lanes on **Thursday, October 17**, 2024\. We need ***everyone*** to show up to support the plan at this important milestone\!

**Your opinion WILL be counted\!** Huge turnout in favor of bike lane protection is critical to make sure this plan is approved\! In order to comment, just drop in for *as little as 10 minutes* to leave a comment on your support for a curb separated bike lane.

**Meeting Details:** Thursday, October 17 | 7:00PM-8:30PM | *Jefferson Bluemle Life Sciences Building  233 S. 10th Street*

*Let us know you are going by clicking the “RSVP” button [here](https://apps.bikeaction.org/events/public-open-house-spruce-pine-otis-community-meeting/).*

The [plan](https://www.phila.gov/media/20241009124537/SprucePine_TrafficSafetyProject_Fall2024_2Pager.pdf) includes a combination of **concrete curb sections** and optional **crash-rated planters** along with additional Loading Zones to meet temporary parking needs. 

Having friendly conversations with other attendees is a powerful way to keep the response to the plan positive. You can use these reasons when explaining your support to neighbors:

* **Separated bike lanes** reduce conflict and stress between drivers and people on bikes.  
* Concrete protection keeps ***all users safe*** including pedestrians and drivers.  
* Separation **limits aggressive driving** and acts as a **buffer** between people on the street and speeding cars.  
* Proposed changes would **prevent drivers from swerving** around other cars, stopping drivers like the one who killed Dr. Barbara Friedes.  
* **Emergency services** review every plan to ensure response times are never impacted.   
* Safe protected bike lanes increase ridership, which **reduces car congestion.**  
* Safe and unobstructed bike lanes **reduce sidewalk riding**.  
* Unlike speed enforcement, concrete buffers offer **24/7 safety** improvements.  
* **Loading Zones** manage unloading needs without putting others at risk.  
* Everyone deserves to **get home alive**, no matter how they choose to travel.
