Hello {{profile.user.first_name}},

**Cast your vote TOMORROW** to elect bike-friendly Board Members to your neighborhood's registered community organization (RCO), [Washington Square West Civic Association](https://washwestcivic.org/). 

Letters of support from RCO Boards are a key way City Council determines "community support" for initiatives like new and protected bike lanes. ***It's critical that residents elect a bike-friendly Board that will support the Spruce/Pine bike lane safety upgrades.***

Philly Bike Action encourages you to vote for the following bike-friendly candidates:

* **Sage Lincoln** (read her Inquirer op-ed [here](https://www.inquirer.com/opinion/commentary/bicycle-deaths-church-bike-lane-parking-permits-20240814.html))  
* **Cristian Hinkley**  
* **Michael Palmer**  
* **Katie Dillon Low**

**Only WSWCA Members can vote.** Become a Member [here](https://app.joinit.com/o/washington-square-west-civic-association) for as little as $10/year. New members should bring a screenshot of their receipt.

[Voting](https://www.instagram.com/p/DCH31-qpDax/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) will take place **in-person** on Tuesday, **November 12** at **7pm** at the Bluemle Life Sciences Building on Jefferson's campus, 233 S. 10th Street. 

**Can't make it?** Request your absentee ballot from [treasurer@washwestcivic.org](mailto:treasurer@washwestcivic.org).

RCOs have considerable power in local politics, so consider voting\!
