If you missed PBA’s District 3 meeting on April 3, here’s a review of the topics we discussed\! We are focused on “action items” that anyone who wants to get involved can focus on.

Everything is important, from assistance with an ongoing project, to planning a two-hour event, to leadership on a bigger initiative. Check out the list below to find something that suits your availability\!

Questions about anything here? Ask Julian (jb\_philly on Discord) or post in the D3 Discord channel\!

    * Call to thank council members for their support of Vision Zero; ask for much more. Be authentic and use personal stories; refer to this [one-pager](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VyqcGDqxMNcORZ15TOe9YgJyELQPRqqg7ri5_bzLFmc/edit?usp=sharing) for more info.

    * If you have an idea for a location, please contact that place and find out if they could host monthly, weeknight meetings for 20+ people (and cost, details, etc)  
    * Even if you don't, we have a list of places that need contacting: respond here to volunteer\!

    * This can be in any park or other public space. We would love to branch out from just Clark Park\!  
    * May coincide with public events for community groups, but doesn't have to  
    * Only 1-2 people needed, any amount of time\!  
    * Table, PBA banner, and other materials available at 44th and Pine  
    * Tabling helps spread the word, expand our mailing list, and fundraise  

* **Have a few hours? It’s easy to lead a bike lane cleanup\!**  

    * There is a great [how-to guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16xUMIkvAhbgr25OEHHEo3AvPApKf5Yp9wIZMq6DQ3FU/edit?usp=sharing) available  
    * LOTS of volunteers are eager to come help—we just need leaders\!

    * Megan is stepping back to time constraints \- but the relationships already exist and she can continue being a resource to support you\!  
    * If interested, contact Megan (megs4945) on Discord  

* **Want a bigger project?** 34th Street is being repaved—it's our best chance to ask for a protected bike lane\!  

  * If you want to coordinate this effort, we'll connect you with people who've worked on similar projects in D3 and around the city\!
