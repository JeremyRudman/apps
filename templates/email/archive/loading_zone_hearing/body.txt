**Short version**: If you have the flexibility **Friday May 2nd 8AM-10AM** to join in-person OR **virtually**, your short comment can help keep Concrete Protection for Spruce and Pine on track\!  

---

A “[Curbside Regulation Public Hearing](https://www.phila.gov/2025-04-25-public-hearing-notice/)” is being held this Friday, May 2nd at 8AM, regarding the new Loading Zones. This regulation change is a necessary step towards Concrete Protection for the **Spruce and Pine** bike lanes. 

We know that there will be strong attendance from the opposition group “FOPS” (who want to keep parking in the bike lane, even though it is now illegal). Your **attendance** and **comment** will help prevent this small group from derailing concrete protection for Spruce and Pine streets.

No registration is necessary to comment in person. If you wish to comment virtually over zoom, you must register [here](https://zoom.us/meeting/register/h7vR-3cERw6clM7YsH83_A#/registration). All comments will be limited to 2 minutes.
