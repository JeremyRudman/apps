[Society Hill Civic Association](https://societyhillcivic.org/) just [published a survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc-F_9fXSFDKMbpdR8fhdvDTh4nKSLgi0KnBmEqhajmDAhGEw/viewform) for Society Hill residents on their views about proposed changes to bike lanes in Society Hill â€“ specifically on Pine, Spruce, and 3rd street.

<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc-F_9fXSFDKMbpdR8fhdvDTh4nKSLgi0KnBmEqhajmDAhGEw/viewform">Take the survey here</a></div>

These responses will likely be reviewed at tomorrow's Society Hill Civic Association meeting, so please submit your responses as **soon as possible**\! It will only take a few moments and will ensure that the Society Hill Civic Association board hears from its residents who ride bikes.
