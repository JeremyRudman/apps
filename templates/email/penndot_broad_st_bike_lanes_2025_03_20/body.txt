PennDOT is collecting feedback on our transportation needs in its biennial [Transportation Survey](https://survey.talkpatransportation.com/#/Survey). 

Send a clear message to PennDOT that we need protected bike lanes citywide, starting on Broad Street\!

Save time by using **Philly Bike Action’s [survey guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18DAkyoXtpyWymOetBJGXq1DY6sHhlGes/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=103354804232340536708&rtpof=true&sd=true)** with our suggested improvements and guidance on how to fill out the survey effectively.

The survey results will influence funding – now is your chance to tell PennDOT where you want protected bike lanes and push back against using our taxpayer dollars for expansion of highways and deadly traffic corridors.

Don’t delay: **the survey closes April 30, 2025**\! We’ll send a reminder email as the deadline approaches. 

Questions on how to complete the survey? Reply to this email and we’ll get back to you.
