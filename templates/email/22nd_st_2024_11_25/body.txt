Subject: Introduce a Bill for the 22nd Street Traffic Safety Project   
   
Councilmember Young,  
   
As a resident of District 5, I want to strongly express my support for the 22nd Street Traffic Safety Project.

This project has already received support from numerous neighborhood groups, including both Fairmount and Spring Garden Civic Associations, Fairmount CDC, Spring Garden CDC, Bache-Martin HSA, Friends of Eastern State Penitentiary Park, and the 15th Ward Democrats. 120 Fairmount residents also signed a petition in support of the project. 

**Please introduce a bill for the 22nd Street Traffic Safety Project** from Pennsylvania Avenue to Brown Street with a parking protected bike lane from Spring Garden Street to Green Street.  
    
\[Insert personal story or experience here\]

Thank you for making our neighborhood safer for all road users.

Sincerely,  
\[Your Name\]  
\[Your Home Address\]
