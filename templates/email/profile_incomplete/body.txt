Hi {{ profile.user.first_name }},

Philly Bike Action has updated our profiles on apps.bikeaction.org to include
some new fields since you created your account.

These new fields are used to determine your Philadelphia City Council District
and relevant Registered Community Organizations. We'll use the resulting
location data to connect you with actions you can take in your specific
neighborhood.

Can you take a moment to return to your profile and fill this data in?

Thank you!

P.S. Sorry if you _did_ provide this information when you signed up.
A misconfiguration caused a handful of signups to not actually save to our
database.
