If you **support protected bike lanes** and have a window above a sidewalk near Spruce or Pine Street, we'd like to get you a **free window poster**\!  We have a limited number of posters, so please only click the button below if you will display the poster in a window where other neighbors will see it.  **We want to show everyone there is strong support for protected bike lanes\!** 

Posters are 11"x14" risograph prints and will be distributed to your home by Philly Bike Action volunteers in the coming weeks.
