OTIS is finalizing their designs for the Fishtown Neighborhood Bikeways [project](https://www.phila.gov/documents/fishtown-bikeways/), which aims to make residential streets safer for people walking and biking. This includes critical potential infrastructure upgrades like contraflow bike lanes, but OTIS needs to know neighbors support these project elements.

Let OTIS know that you: 

1. **SUPPORT the contraflow bike lane on Palmer St. near Palmer Park.**

2. **SUPPORT a contraflow bike lane on Columbia Ave. near Delaware Ave. to connect the neighborhood to Penn Treaty Park and the Delaware River Trail.** The current plan directs bicyclists onto a narrow sidewalk with pedestrians near a bus stop.
