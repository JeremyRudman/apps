Hello {{ profile.user.first_name }}, *You are receiving this email from [Philly Bike Action](https://bikeaction.org/) because you have a PBA account. This is our 2nd Vine St email – if you’ve already submitted feedback, thank you! There is no need to do so again.*

Last chance to provide feedback on [PennDOT’s Concept Plan for Vine Street](https://www.pa.gov/agencies/penndot/projects-near-you/district-6-projects/vine-st-corridor-safety-improvements.html) \-- **Comment form closes tomorrow!**

<span style="width: 80%; text-align: center;"><img style="width: 100%; border-radius: 5px; border: solid grey;" src="templates/email/vine_street_2025_01_30/images/vine_street_safety_improvements_project_location_map.jpg"></span>

PennDOT is [collecting a second round of feedback](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=iYN8F3s7qEm36MfzaGvgSWlpo6d20elGqQ2khlGtQVZUMzFZUDlTNUlLM0YzMUFKM0M4WDNOOVg5Sy4u&route=shorturl) on its plans to install safety improvements on Vine St, which include **eastbound and westbound bike lanes**. Unfortunately, their revised plans will make the eastbound bike lane **more dangerous** by placing it between a travel lane and a parking lane, which will put bicyclists in the dangerous “door zone.”

*It is critical that those who support better bike infrastructure and safer streets provide their input on this project*.

Tell PennDOT not to backtrack on safety by using these recommended answers on the [public comment form](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=iYN8F3s7qEm36MfzaGvgSWlpo6d20elGqQ2khlGtQVZUMzFZUDlTNUlLM0YzMUFKM0M4WDNOOVg5Sy4u&route=shorturl)**:**

1. **Do you support the addition of a westbound bike lane on Vine Street from 13th Street to 9th Street?**

	Yes, but the bike lane should be next to the curb and protected.

	Extend the bike lane to Broad Street.

	If needed, remove street parking to protect the bike lane.

2. **Do you support the reconfiguration of bike lanes on the 10th and 13th Street overpasses by shifting the bike lane to curbside with added lane separator curb?**

	Yes.

3. **Do you support maintaining metered street parking along Vine Street EB between 11th Street and 9th Street?**

	No, because the bike lane should be next to the curb and protected.

	The safety of bike lane users will be compromised by this added parking.

	Restore the design from Version 1\.

4. **Do you support the installation of speed slots (speed humps) with signing and advanced pavement markings along Vine Street WB between 10th Street and 8th Street?**

	Yes.

	Also install speed slots in the school zone between 13th and Broad. 

5. **Do you support the installation of School Zone Pavement Markings along Vine Street WB?**

	  
	Yes.

6. **Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback on the revised concept. Please use the space below to provide any additional comments regarding the project.**

	Extend the Vine Street WB road diet to Broad Street.
