# Philly Bike Action Code of Conduct

*Adapted from the [Rust Code of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct)*

## **Purpose**

*The purpose of the code of conduct is to 1\) **ensure a safe environment** **for everyone** involved in PBA in-person events and on our Discord server. 2\) **maintain the energy and focus of the organization towards improving bike infrastructure**.*

*The primary focus of Philly Bike Action will always be improving cycling infrastructure in Philadelphia. The Code of Conduct and Enforcement Policies are designed to further that aim and PBA Leadership will take steps to eliminate, minimize, or mitigate distractions and hindrances to that mission. There is absolutely no room at PBA events or on PBA platforms for **hateful speech or actions, vandalism of personal or public property, or harassment** of PBA Members or non-Members.* 

## **Code of Conduct**

The policies listed below apply to all Philly Bike Action venues; including Discord channels, in-person events, social media, and any other private or public communications. 

1. **We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all**, regardless of level of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other similar characteristic.

2. **Vandalism or harassment of cars or drivers** or language or posts suggesting such actions **will not be tolerated.** It does not further our mission. Anyone seen doing these things will not be welcome back to official PBA events.

3. **Overtly sexual language** **or images** including jokes or in aliases or other nicknames **is not allowed**. Cursing is allowed, but never targeting another user or attendee, and never in a hateful manner.

4. Please **be kind and courteous**. We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass anyone. We interpret the term “harassment” as including the definition in the [Citizen Code of Conduct](https://github.com/stumpsyn/policies/blob/master/citizen_code_of_conduct.md). If you have any lack of clarity about what might be included in that concept, please read their definition. In particular, we don’t tolerate behavior that excludes people in socially marginalized groups.

5. Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome.

6. **Respect differences of opinion**. Safe street design is often complex, and there is not always a single correct solution. Expect differences of opinions and be prepared to agree to disagree and learn from others around you.

7. During meetings, in person or virtual, **be considerate of time constraints** by staying mindful of how long you speak and **allowing space for everyone to speak in turn**.

## **Enforcement**

These are the policies for upholding our community’s standards of conduct, in-person and on Discord. **If you feel that a thread needs moderation, please contact the Philly Bike Action leadership** via email or Discord direct message.

1. Remarks that violate the Philly Bike Action standards of conduct, including hateful, hurtful, oppressive, or exclusionary remarks, may be deleted. Remarks that leadership finds inappropriate, whether listed in the code of conduct or not, will also be deleted. You may be notified by a moderator when your message is deleted.

2. If violating messages are repeated, the member is subject to be banned from the Discord.

3. Behavior exhibited online or in person that violates the Code of Conduct may result in exclusion from in-person events and meetings.

4. Leadership may choose at their discretion to un-ban the user.

5. If a moderator bans someone and you think it was unjustified, please take it up with that moderator, or with a different moderator, **in private**. Complaints about bans in-channel are not allowed.

6. Leadership is held to a higher standard than other community members. If a moderator creates an inappropriate situation, they should expect less leeway than others.

## **Report a Code of Conduct Violation**

*If you or someone involved in the situation is in immediate danger, please contact the appropriate crisis number, non-emergency number, or police number.* 

Harassment is unacceptable. No matter who you are, **if you feel you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable by a community member, please contact any of the Philly Bike Action leadership immediately.** Whether you’re a regular contributor or a newcomer, we care about making this community a safe place for you and we’ve got your back.
