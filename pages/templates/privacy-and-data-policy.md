## **8\. TRANSFER OF PERSONAL INFORMATION ACROSS BORDERS**

PBA is a United States organization, headquartered in the United States. While we are not a global company, we may allow your personal information to be shared with third-party service providers based both within the United States and in other countries. This may entail a transfer of your personal information from a location within the European Economic Area to outside the European Economic Area, or from outside the European Economic Area to a location within the Economic European Area.

When we provide your personal information overseas, we do so in connection with providing information or services or as required or authorized under law. It is possible the overseas entities, which we share your information with, may not be subject to foreign laws that provide the same level of protection of information with, may not be subject to foreign laws that provide the same level of protection of information as your country of residence or employment, or may not be subject to any privacy obligations. Overseas entities may be required or compelled to disclose your personal information to a third party, such as an overseas authority. Where we transfer information outside of the European Economic Areas, we will implement appropriate measures to ensure that your personal information remains protected and secure in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
